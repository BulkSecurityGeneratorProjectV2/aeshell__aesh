With the help of link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] and it's 
link:https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[native image] feature, it is now possible
to generate a standalone executable from Java code. The native image do not require Java to execute and
usually starts up faster and require less memory compared to usual Java programs.

Generating these images however is often not straightforward unfortunately as the native image generator
has some link:https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/#aot-compilation-limitations[limitations]
that makes it a bit cumbersome.

Luckily Ã†sh has a built-in utility that will generate a .json file for you to make this a lot easier.

For a complete example please have a look at the
